        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>~15 min (+1 hour of chilling)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, cut into small cubes <em>(cold)</em></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold water <em>(plus one ice cube)</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the water/vinegar mixture.</strong> Drop an ice-cube into a measuring cup and fill the measuring cup up with water to the Â½ cup mark. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix Flour and Butter.</strong> Combine the dry ingredients together in a medium-sized bowl and toss with a fork to mix evenly. Use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture forms large, coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Water.</strong> Pour the water mixture, a few tablespoons at a time, into the flour/butter mixture and toss with a fork until the dough is evenly moist. Add water slowly to get the right texture. </li>
            <li><strong>Gather the dough.</strong> Use your hands to quickly bring the dough together in the bowl. Do not over work the dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Divide and Chill.</strong> Divide the dough in half and flatten into disks. Wrap the disks separately in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. </li>
            <li><strong>Bake</strong> according to what your pie recipe calls for. </li>
        </ol>
